## Introduction

The original library [website](https://kutuphane.deu.edu.tr/) doesn't provide any information about current occupation data also had several issues, including slow loading times and cluttered interface.

We have streamlined the interface, optimized the website's performance, and ensured that it is fully responsive across all devices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Occupation Data:** Displays current library occupancy levels.
- **Past Borrowing Data:** Shows statistics on how many books have been borrowed historically.
- **Fast Loading:** Optimized for quick access to information.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive navigation and layout.

## Technologies Used
